<p>First and foremost, we are here to support our clients. There are many ways we can help in the area of Web Design. From creating a new site from scratch and maintaining it for you, to teaching you how to build and maintain your own site. Our goal is to help you in whatever capacity we can and we have an array of options, and prices, to suit your needs.</p>
<h2 id="tell-us-about-your-site">Tell us about your site.</h2>
<p>Consulting is our core, we will guide you to the best choices for your needs. Sit down with a designer and tell us how you see your site. The vision and ideas that define your brand. Send over your logos, text, and images. If you need a logo or images, we can help with that as well. An amazing website is the first impression of your brand.</p>
<h2 id="diy-to-building-your-site-for-you">DIY to building your site for you.</h2>
<p>We pride ourselves on giving you the level of service you deserve. If you&rsquo;re just looking for a place to start, check out our articles for a free resource, particularly the one on how to “google” your problem.
But if you’re looking for more hands, that’s what we are here for. We can do as little as teaching you the tools we use to fully building out your site for you, and of course anything in between.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-you-get-with-a-colbal">What do you get with a Colbal.</h2>
<p>No page limit, always a mobile responsive site (unless you don’t want that), basic search engine optimization, custom forms, and more.</p>
<h2 id="e-commerce">E-commerce?</h2>
<p>For e-commerce we suggest using Shopify. In our opinion they have the best all around tools for online stores. Anyone selling your less, is selling you short.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-blogs">What about blogs?</h2>
<p>For us, blogs alone are considered one page sites. The reason for this is because it’s a page of other pages linked to it. We can definitely build a blog site out for you. We recommend checking out our article <a href="https://www.colbal.com/posts/discover-the-secret-to-launching-your-own-blog-on-a-budget-github-netlify-and-hugo/">Discover the Secret to Launching Your Own Blog on a Budget: Github, Netlify and Hugo</a> for a overview if you are a DIY&rsquo;er.</p>
