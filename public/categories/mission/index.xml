      <description>My take on the situation.
First, to ensure we are all on the same foot, lets define Open Source and Close Source.
Open Source is some product, whether that is software or hardware, that is made available with the full possibility or intention for the user to make changes.
Close Source, also called proprietary, is some product, whether that is software or hardware, in which any modification or changes can been seen illegal and can be subject to legal action.</description>
