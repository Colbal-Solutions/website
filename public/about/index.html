<p>After more than 20 years working in the technology industry, we had noticed that the majority of tech companies focus on medium to large businesses, with services that are usually cost-prohibitive to smaller companies. We are here to help small, even tiny, businesses leverage the same technology used in big tech to cut costs, increase revenue, and to make life easier. Not that we are non-profit, but a high tide raises all ships. We seek to create abundance, not sucking every little penny out of our customers. Our solutions are customized for your needs and your wallet, so we can rise together and continue working together into the future.</p>
<h2 id="back-story">Back Story</h2>
<p>Just like any good back story, ours starts with tragedy. Not with of major trauma at a young age like that of the comics. No our tragedy comes from watching our family&rsquo;s owned businesses drown in the ever increasing technological world around us. Their business couldn&rsquo;t keep up with the cost or the pace of technology. So we stepped in, did the research, developed the solution, and showed just how much time, effort and costs could be save with the technology.</p>
<h2 id="veteran-owned-and-operated">Veteran Owned and Operated</h2>
<p>We don&rsquo;t like to make a big deal out of it but the founders of Colbal are all veterans. They have taken the leadership skills, drive, and discipline learned during military service and have build a company that is the example of small consulting firms.</p>
