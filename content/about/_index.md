## Back Story
Just like any good back story, ours starts with tragedy. Not with of major trauma at a young age like that of the comics. No our tragedy comes from watching our family's owned businesses drown in the ever increasing technological world around us. Their business couldn't keep up with the cost or the pace of technology. So we stepped in, did the research, developed the solution, and showed just how much time, effort and costs could be save with the technology.

## Veteran Owned and Operated
We don't like to make a big deal out of it but the founders of Colbal are all veterans. They have taken the leadership skills, drive, and discipline learned during military service and have build a company that is the example of small consulting firms.
