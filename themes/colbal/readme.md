# Scratch

Hugo theme with only the bare bones. Intended to be a starter for creating themes.

## Additions

## Getting started

Inside your project folder, copy the theme to your `themes` folder. Since you're just using it as a starter for your theme, remove the git history.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Colbal-Solutions/scratch themes/your-theme-name
rm -rf themes/your-theme-name/.git
```
